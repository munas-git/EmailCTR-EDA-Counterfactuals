# Context

Click-through rate (CTR) is a critical metric in digital marketing, representing the effectiveness of online advertisements in driving user engagement. Optimising CTR helps reduce customer acquisition costs and improve campaign ROI. Unlike traditional marketing methods, online campaigns are data-driven and scalable, allowing for advanced targeting strategies. [This dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swekerr/click-through-rate-prediction) contains data related to click/no-click recorded for different users. ***In this analysis, I will be answering the following questions:***

#### EDA-Based Questions (Exploratory Data Analysis

1. ***How does user demographic information (age, income) relate to CTR?***

2. ***Do time-based behavior (e.g., daily time spent on site, internet usage, timestamp patterns) influence likelihood of clicking on ads?***  

3. ***Are there geographic differences in ad engagement (by city or country)?***  

4. ***Do certain 'Ad Topic Line' perform better in terms of CTR?***  

5. ***What is the relationship between internet use and time on site, and how do those correlate with CTR?***

### Post Model-Training/Counterfactual Questions

6. ***Which user attributes (age, income, location...) are most influential in driving ad clicks, according to the predictive model?***

7. ***Which feature groups are most associated with unpredictable or inaccurate model predictions?***

8. ***Which types of users are most responsive to changes in key factors?***  

9. ***What changes in timing or targeting can boost engagement among the least responsive users?***  

10. ***What hidden trends or unexpected feature combinations did the model uncover that could inform more effective marketing strategies moving forward?***
